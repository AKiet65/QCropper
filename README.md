# QCropper
This project aims to provide an image cropping experience like iOS Photos.app

I wrote the Objective-C version of QCropper for my company a few years ago, based on earlier versions of [TOCropViewController](https://github.com/TimOliver/TOCropViewController) and [PhotoTweaks](https://github.com/itouch2/PhotoTweaks). Now I am going to say goodbye to UIKit in advance, so I (as a newbee to the open source community) created this Swift version and let it open source
